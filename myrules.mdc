IMPORTANT:
- When working on larger tasks or planning, use `create_task`, `list_tasks`, `get_task`, `complete_task`, `update_task`, `delete_task`, and `break_down_task` to keep track of what needs to be done.
- If the user asks to think deeply, call the `sequentialthinking` tool.
- If the next work is ambiguous, use `list_tasks` to figure out what to do.
